Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (8 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 8 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Reading alignment file COI_wEvi.fa ... Fasta format detected
Alignment most likely contains DNA/RNA sequences
Alignment has 156 sequences with 523 columns, 136 distinct patterns
116 parsimony-informative, 35 singleton sites, 372 constant sites
