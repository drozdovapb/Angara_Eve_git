Host:    drozdovapb-HP-17-by1xxx (AVX2, FMA3, 11 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree2 -s 18S_wEvi.aln -bb 1000 -abayes -o Evi_Listv --redo
Seed:    306332 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Wed Nov  1 12:11:35 2023
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (8 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 8 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Reading alignment file 18S_wEvi.aln ... Fasta format detected
Alignment most likely contains DNA/RNA sequences
Alignment has 156 sequences with 467 columns, 13 distinct patterns
5 parsimony-informative, 3 singleton sites, 459 constant sites
